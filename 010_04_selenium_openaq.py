# What do you need?
# - Find forms, find elements in the webpage
# - get that data - organize it
# - fill out forms and submit it - get more data from other pages
# - scroll
# - wait on results - wait for the page to load completely
# - get something (image/text/video) and store it somewhere
# - visualize that data
# - clicking on buttons and links

# use Ctrl + Shift + C - to pop up the browser tools - debugger - and to check for the elements by hovering

# element.click()
# element.text
# element.get_attribute('class')
# element.send_keys('mypassword')
